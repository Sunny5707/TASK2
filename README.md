A real-time chat application is designed to help people communicate instantly, allowing messages to be sent and received without any noticeable delay. These apps usually work using technologies like WebSockets or HTTP/2 to keep the communication flowing seamlessly. The main features of these apps include real-time messaging, where users can chat instantly, as well as the ability to send pictures, videos, voice messages, and files. Security is a priority, so users often need to log in, and they receive notifications when new messages come inâ€”even if the app is running in the background. These apps often support group chats, show whether a message has been delivered or read, and let users know when someone is typing. They also allow users to look back at past conversations through chat history and make sure messages are private with end-to-end encryption. Plus, real-time chat apps work across different devices, so you can keep your conversations synced whether you're on your phone, computer, or tablet. They also let you know if someone is online or offline, which is great for knowing when your friends or colleagues are available. These features make real-time chat apps popular for everything from social media to customer support and team collaboration.
